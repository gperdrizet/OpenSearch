    "# Reference removal classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "After some initial semantic chunking experiments, it became apparent that the reference list is included with the text of each article. Unfortunately, there is no section header or any other obvious formatting that could make it easy to remove the reference list. For some articles, as much as 1/3 of the text is references. We need a good way to remove them in the Wikipedia extraction phase or maybe in the semantic chunking phase - I could imagine wanting to do this with other data sources too. Either way, let's see what we can come up with. Here is the plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split some articles into sentences and manually label them as 'text' or 'reference' to create training data.\n",
    "2. Use Scikit-learn's TFIDF or count vectorizer to prepare the data\n",
    "3. Train a classifier of some sort on it. My thought was XGBoost, but I have seen a few tutorials where people use a Multinomial Naive Bayes model (*sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB*)\n",
